🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System
📌 Overview

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of different diseases using patient health data.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment using Streamlit.
